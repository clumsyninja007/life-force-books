            <b>Our books investigate</b> the Life Force phenomenon in all its aspects:
            energy cultivation techniques, sexual alchemy, self-healing, diaphragmatic
            deep breathing, <InnerLink content="Prana" href="https://bit.ly/VSL21" />, overcoming Karmic bondage, facing death without
            fear, <InnerLink content="kundalini" href="https://www.commonsensekundalini.com/science_spirituality/" />,
            NDE, OBE, bodily rejuvenation, Raw Foods, spontaneous appearance of
            creative talents, aptitudes, or faculties, and slowing down the aging process.
            Often, this type of investigation takes the form of a personal transformation,
            investigators finding methods that work and setting aside those that do not.
            In other words, creative individuals using the scientific method to verify
            metaphysical experiences. How do they do this? They use their bodies as
            laboratories and their powers of observation to verify empirically each and
            every step of the transformational process.

            <b>Up to now</b> self-styled holy men and gurus have told us Kundalini was an esoteric
            process for raising consciousness. They’ve told us they could instruct novices and
            experts alike — as long as they were willing to pay. The problem is that classifying
            Kundalini as a means to “spiritual enlightenment” limits its benefits to a realm many
            people have neither the time nor the inclination to explore. What’s more, many people
            are put off by terms like “higher consciousness” and “enlightenment.” On the other hand,
            if they knew that Kundalini Meditation had therapeutic health benefits, they’d be eager
            to learn about it. Says JJ Semple, “My students tell me, ‘Don't give me something to believe
            in; give me something to DO! I want techniques for self-healing. I also want to awaken, to
            become enlightened.’” I tell them that, even with an aroused kundalini, awakening is a gradual
            process: “The ultimate aim of meditation is to become more and more conscious. Enlightenment,
            therefore, is becoming fully conscious, and I’ve never met anyone who’s accomplished that
            overnight.” Perhaps, you don’t think there’s such a thing as “The Life Force.” You’d be mistaken.
            Our books on kundalini and energy cultivation techniques cover a variety of topics ranging
            from <InnerLink content="kundalini meditation" href="/life-force-science" /> to sexual alchemy;
            they feature accounts of  energy activation that can only be understood as the stirring of
            a <InnerLink content="life force energy" href="https://www.commonsensekundalini.com/science_spirituality/the-energy-continuum.html" />.
            There is no other explanation.

            <h2>The Fortuitous Rediscovery of an Ancient Method</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            <b>According to the Dalai Lama</b>, in the material world, scientists use a paradigm where,
            “only knowledge derived through a strict empirical method underpinned by observation, inference,
            and experimental verification can be considered valid.” Perhaps naively, but with utmost conviction,
            Life Force Books asks: Why can’t these same principles be applied to the metaphysical world? We
            believe that JJ Semple’s work with Kundalini supports this hypothesis. Why?
          </p>
          <p>
            Years ago, a stranger handed JJ Semple a book called, <em>The Secret of the Golden Flower</em>. Not only
            was he not a scholar, he had trouble understanding the yogic practices of this book, not to mention its
            metaphysical aspects. Eventually, he realized it was a treatise on meditation and sexual alchemy, but he
            wondered if such an ancient text could apply to the modern world. Were its precepts still valid? Only after
            practicing it did he find the answer — that the metaphysical is the result of certain physical practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along the way there were lots of twists and turns, false starts and missteps. Nevertheless, he persisted.
            “As a result of my practice,” says JJ Semple, “my body has been wholly reconditioned, my health restored.
            Moreover, the meditation I practiced corrected a <InnerLink content="childhood deformity" href="/store/the-backward-flowing-method" />.
            Long after, I discovered this healing miracle was due to a secret breath control technique called
            the <InnerLink content="backward-flowing method" href="/store/the-backward-flowing-method" />, the application of
            which, led to the <InnerLink content="permanent awakening of my Kundalini" href="https://www.commonsensekundalini.com/my_kundalini_experience/" />.
            Once awakened, my Kundalini triggered a sexual sublimation mechanism — the Life Force, I call it — which
            then sought out and corrected any and all structural imperfections.” These discoveries are described his
            book, <InnerLink content={<em>Deciphering the Golden Flower One Secret at a Time</em>} href="/store/deciphering-the-golden-flower" />.

            <h2>GFM Assures a Predictable Outcome</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            Deciphering <em>The Secret of the Golden Flower</em> and condensing its secrets into a viable method of
            kundalini meditation took time, over thirty years, in fact. Now, having personally verified the effectiveness
            of this method and its healing capabilities, JJ Semple realized it was time to reveal the ancient wisdom of the
            Golden Flower to the world. “I’ve modernized it into a six-step method I
            call <InnerLink content="Golden Flower Meditation" href="https://www.goldenflowermeditation.com/" /> (GFM).
          </p>
          <p>
            “When people ask me what GFM is about, I reply, it’s more than Kundalini, it’s a self-study course in empirical
            Life Force Science, an approach to living anyone can apply. It’s a system that makes healing bodily imperfections
            and <InnerLink content="restoring overall health" href="/store/the-backward-flowing-method" /> the primary goals.”

            <h2>Kundalini-Life Force Science and Dying</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            Scared to death of dying? <em>You don’t have to be</em>. Death is a natural occurrence, yet most people don’t
            realize they can plan for it while still alive. <InnerLink content={<em>The Backward-Flowing Method: The Secret of Life and Death</em>} href="/store/the-backward-flowing-method" /> provides
            instruction on self-awareness training and specific energy cultivation techniques used in the Science and
            Art of Dying. That’s right, DEATH. The Big D! By learning the backward-flowing method, a powerful alchemical/meditation technique,
            you will master the secrets to <InnerLink content="prolonging life" href="/store/the-backward-flowing-method" /> and practice
            the procedures used by the ancient adepts in their preparations for death. Learn the secrets of Tibetan and Chinese alchemy.
            Prepare for the inevitable while there’s still time.
          </p>
          <p>
            “My work,” says JJ Semple, “is inspired by a variety of teachers, writers and practitioners, including Gopi Krishna, Milarepa, and Lao Tse.”
